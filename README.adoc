== Description

My micro project is about a bus management system which is used by people who travel by bus and drivers who want to look up their daily schedule. The busses are divided into school busses and daily busses, the type of bus has nothing to do with the schedule or accessibility. Important note: Currently the drivers can only see the bus they are supposed to drive but not how long their shift is going to be (this was removed due to complexity issues).

== Technical Background

The reason behind this micro project is to put the theoretical lessons into practice. In the future, this may include a Quarkus Backend, Android frontend, and more stuff.
